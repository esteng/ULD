Steps for running on cluster 
----------------------------

1. ssh into your computecanada account, either on cedar or graham (e.g. `ssh <user>@cedar.computecanada.ca`)
	- if you don't have a computecanada account, follow these instructions to get one: https://www.computecanada.ca/research-portal/account-management/apply-for-an-account/
	- Right now the accounts are through Morgan, so contact him for the PI information 
2. clone the repo into your user's folder (should be under `~/project/<user>` once you've ssh'd in)
3. navigate to the home directory and load python 
	- `module load python/3.5.4`
4. create a virtualenv for the project and activate it (or just activate it if you have already created it before)
	- `virtualenv uld`
	- and/or `source ~/uld/bin/activate`
5. navigate to the ULD/code directory and install the requirements 
	- `pip install -r requirements.txt`
6. jobs are submitting/run via scripts. It's fairly trivial to turn the `run_full` script into a script that can run on the cluster. 
	- First, change the name to `run_full.sh` and make sure that the permissions allow it to be executed. 
	- prepend the following chunk: 
	```
	#!/bin/bash
	#SBATCH --account=def-msonde1
	#SBATCH --ntasks=32               # number of MPI processes
	#SBATCH --mem-per-cpu=64G      # memory; default unit is megabytes
	#SBATCH --time=0-36:00          # time (DD-HH:MM)
	ipcluster stop;
	```

	You can change the number of processes, memory, and expected time. Note that all of these are considered by the scheduler when scheduling your job -- the higher they are (especially time) the later your job gets scheduled. If you want to test something out, it's best to set low time limits and use little memory/few processes until you're sure that your job will run in its entirety. 

7. To submit your job, input `sbatch run_full.sh`. To see the status of your job, you can input `squeue -u <username>`. To cancel a job, input `scancel <jobid>` or `scancel -u <username>` to cancel all your jobs. The stdout output of your job will be in an autogenerated file called `slurm-<jobid>.out`. However, run_full.sh redirects most of the output to debug.txt.
