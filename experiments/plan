experiments
-----------
- LibriSpeech
    - per-speaker 
    - g2p and phonetic alignment 

tests
-----
quantitative
------------
- frame-level error rate /accuracy
- cluster purity with MFA aligned data
    • information theoretic measure for cluster purity etc. 
    • look at alignment of top to bottom and bottom to top
    • view both categories (top, bottom) as clusters of frames
- autogenerate list that's like phone, top context + plu_bot + top context
- segmentation accuracy
    • how close are our phone boundaries (precision/recall)

qualitative
-----------
- look at narrow alignment
- look at phonological phenomenon that involves insertion/deletion vs pronunciation dictionary
- allophony
