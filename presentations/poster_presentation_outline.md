# poster presentation outline

## describe the problem
- unsupervised learning intro (Elias) 
- language acquisition -- linguistic problem being solved (Emily)  

## the model 
- broad structure (Emily) 
- setting the stage for generative models (Emily)
	- making certain assumptions 
	- data generated by our model
	- doing inference to find parameters of the model that
- why this model (Elias) 
	- train on less speech data
	- linguistically accurate/interesting 


## our contribution
- Variational Bayes (Elias)
	- intro to why VB  
		- inference problem 
		- faster 
	- what is VB
		- high-level explanation of what you're optimizing    
	-why now?
		- VB implementations available 
		- more computing power available easily
- Noisy channel (Emily) 

## Model structure
 maximize the likelihood of the input data  
- from the generative perspective, with relevant latent variables
- Adaptor grammar (Elias)
- Noisy channel
	- generative (Emily) 
	- inference (Elias) 
- DPHMM (Emily) 

## Future work
- Experiments to run (Emily) 
- possible engineering applications (Elias)
